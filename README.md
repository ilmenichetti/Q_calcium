# Analyzing the residuals in predicting Ca^++^ depletion caused by forest logging residuals harvest

Author: Lorenzo Menichetti

Financing: FOMA acidification research grant

This project aims at integrating the decomposition model Q into a prediction framework for forest acidification, in particular to predict the potential losses due to organic matter decomposition and the consequent vulnerability of the Ca^++^ stocks. Knowing how management will release the Ca accumulated in the organic matter (living and dead), and with which kinetic, can help us to better program forest interventions and minimize Ca^++^ losses, particularly in situation where acidification is crucial to fertility (such as already degraded sites).
