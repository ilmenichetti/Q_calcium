# 0 Starting point
The Q model in its former calibration [@hyvonenPredictingLongTermSoil1998] can represent relatively well the litterfall Ca^++^ fluxes, as in this draft simulation:
![Fig.1: The drafted simulation, without considering uncertainty, based on Q](Figures/Simulation_draft.png)
The model is driven by littertrap data and by assumptions about CWD data. 

# 1 Extending Q to predict potential Ca^++^ mineralization with uncertainty

# 1.2 Uncertainty implementation

We can consider the uncertainty of the model predictions by extending forward the uncertainty estimated for Q previously estimated (**Ecosphere publication, accepted. Put reference as soon as it's published**). Such calibration produced a set of possible parameter values within a certain confidence interval of predictions (based on the calibration decomposition dataset of the study), and we can assume that the parameter uncertainty will be the same in this case. We can therefore run multiple iterations of the model using the former calibration parameter sets to produce margins of uncertainty.
The terms u0 and tmax are calculated, with an error term added from the model calibration. The maximum tree diameter has been assumed as 13.5 centimeters, from the average of the dataset of the model calibration [@makinenPREDICTINGDECOMPOSITIONSCOTS2006]. The term u0 is calculated from latitude according to @hyvonenPredictingLongTermSoil1998 based on the relationship $u0=0.0855+0.0157*(50.6-0.768*latitude)$. Error terms to these values are added based on the model calibration in (**Ecosphere publication, accepted. Put reference as soon as it's published**).

![Fig.2: The simulation considering uncertainty, based on Q](Figures/Simulation_range.png)

The model is run considering only priors from the former calibration, without updating them with new information. This is because there is very little information to constrain the model. It would be possible to use the litterfall Ca^++^ data to update the priors, but then those data would influence the whole calibration and the updated parameter distributions (based on litterfall) would influence also the kinetics of the CWD decomposition. Given the importance of the latter in sudden pulses (which are the most dangerous in terms of Ca^++^ losses), we preferred not to update the calibration since it was based on (and optimized for) CWD kinetics.

# 2 Extending Ca^++^ vulnerability predictions for Aneboda to future climate scenarios

## 2.1 Calcium content and climate
Calcium content in different tree species is known to be linked with precipitations. We will utilize the relationship expressed in @bergCalciumDecomposingFoliar2017 for linking our modeling results with the climatic projections from SMHI. 
![Relationship between Calcium content and precipitation, from ](Figures/Berg_2017_Fig2.png)

The future climate scenarios will be derived from the average for Sweden produced by SMHI The future climate scenarios will be derived from the average for Sweden produced by SMHI [(https://www.smhi.se/en/climate/future-climate/climate-scenarios/sweden/nation/rcp45/year/precipitation)](https://www.smhi.se/en/climate/future-climate/climate-scenarios/sweden/nation/rcp45/year/precipitation): 
![Future precipitations in Sweden, from https://www.smhi.se/en/climate/future-climate/climate-scenarios/sweden/nation/rcp45/year/precipitation](Figures/n_ar_swe_rcp45_y.png)
data are reported as \% variation relative to current precipitation, so I chose as a reference level 750 mm MAP as stated in the annual reports.

## 2.2 Extending the predictions for Aneboda considering future climatic scenarios

### 2.2.1 Future Ca vulnerability assuming constant input and climate
First of all we need to assume some future C inputs. For simplicity we assume a conservation scenario, and extend the inputs 50 years in the future by using a mean (of the whole time series):
![Assumptions on the future C input scenario](Figures/Future_input_scenario.png)
This produces the following predictions concerning the Ca^++^ ions:
![Future predictions with constant climate and inputs](Figures/Simulation_range_future.png)

This picture is of course highly dependent on the inputs, in particular the CWD inputs.

### 2.2.1 Future Ca vulnerability assuming constant input and changing climate
When considering instead future climate, we can simulate the effect of the foreseen change in precipitation in the Ca content of the biomass:
![Predicted future precipitations in Aneboda, and the consequent Ca:C ratio in the biomass](Figures/precipitations_predictions.png)

We then use these data to drive a new decomposition simulation:
